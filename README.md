# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on sentiment analysis of movie reviews.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to classify movie reviews into positive and negative sentiments using various machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of movie reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels. It is sourced from [insert dataset source here].

## Model Building

We experiment with several machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Linear SVM, and Random Forest, to build classification models for sentiment analysis.

## Evaluation

We evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we visualize the performance metrics to compare the models and gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` to train and evaluate the models.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
